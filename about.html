        I explore different geographic landscapes, examining myself in these spaces; but most importantly how I fit in these
        various environments. Through monochromatic light and shadows, I attempt to visualize emotions of loneliness,
        detachment, and disconnection. Self-portraits through shadows document my presence in different environments but also
        fails to reveal my connection to these places. This inward point of view allows me to reflect and think about how I
        occupy different places. Multiple exposures allow me to create my own world to inhabit space within. What my eyes see is
        not something that anyone else will ever see. This results in an outward interpretation of the world that only exists as
        a metaphysical reality. The duality of my inward self-portraits and outward landscapes are equally important in
        examining how I connect with the rest of the world. My abstracted landscapes don’t attempt to depict reality but instead
        attempt to explore the relationships humans have to land. I hope to continue exploring these relationships, further
        challenging the ideas of photography; as a means of documentation and truth.
